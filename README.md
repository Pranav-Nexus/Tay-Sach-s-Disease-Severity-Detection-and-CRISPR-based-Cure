# Tay-Sach-s-Disease-Severity-Detection-and-CRISPR-based-Cure
Detection of severity of Tay Sach’s disease using Machine Learning models  and implementing a cure using CRISPR based genome editing

This project’s aim is to identify Tay Sach’s disease and determine its severity using data 
retrieved from the patients DNA. This can be done via genome sequencing. The severity of 
Tay Sach’s Disease can be identified by physical parameters namely the location of the 
mutation, allele change and type of mutation. In this project we have used the following 
machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, KNN (K Nearest Neighbours), SVM
(Support Vector Machines), Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest.

If the algorithm determines the severity of Tay Sach’s Disease is fatal (Malignant), the 
patient is recommended to undergo treatment via genome editing. Genome editing (also 
called gene editing) is a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an 
organism's DNA. These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered 
at particular locations in the genome. A well-known genome editing technology known as 
CRISPR-Cas9 is a cheap, fast and highly accurate technology that has let genome editing 
progress at a faster rate. This project also shows the working of CRISPR to cure Tay Sachs 
Disease caused by 6 different mutations.
